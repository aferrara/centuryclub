Century Club
============

## Overview

"The Century Club" is a drinking game, and it is known by some other names like "Centurion". The element of luck is reduced to almost nothing, and there is a strong strategic component.

The aim of the gaim is to consume 100 x 30ml shots of beer, one a minute, every minute, for 100 minutes. This should add up to 8 standard bottles of beer in one hour and 40 minutes, which is not an obscene amount of alcohol.

Like any game, there are a bunch of rules. When a player breaks the rules, they will be disqualified and have the number of shots recorded as their score.


## Here are the rules

* You must be using the same beer as the rest of the players.
* You must pour your own shots of beer.
* Your shot glass must be contain least 30ml of liquid beer, not including froth.
* Once beer is poured into your shot glass, it can only leave by drinking it. **No pouring out, or back into bottle**
* You must drink when the time keepers call the minute.
* You can go to the toilet during the game, but you must be back before the minute is up to take your next shot.
* You cannot throw up.


## Remember, it is a game.

It is a game, and it should be fun. The amount of alcohol consumed in this game is not extreme, although, as with all things related to alcohol, be careful.
